How to play:
HUNGRY CAT.

It makes a musical intro, and then you are the apple and you must ran away from the cat. If 
you survive for the first 5 seconds, you go on to the next level. If not, the cat eats the apple 
(you don't see the apple bitten, but the apple plays the sound that it's game over), and it's 
GAME OVER. Next level is harder because the cat is going faster. After the 5th level you win. 
The apple is controled by the mouse: where is mouse, there is the apple.
